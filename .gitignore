# Extent Reports
# Extent reports are usually generated inside the 'target' directory,
# but if you have them outside, you might need to add specific paths.
# Since 'target/' is already ignored, this covers most cases.
# If your reports are generated directly in the project root, uncomment and adjust:
# ExtentReports/
# *.html # If your report is directly in root, e.g., extent-report.html

# TestNG specific (if any generated files outside target)
test-output/ # TestNG's default output directory
testng-customsuite.xml
testng-failed.xml

# Any other temporary or generated files
